### Macroeconomic Research Framework

This repository contains macroeconomic data analysis focused on inflation dynamics,
component-wise dispersion, and inflation index construction using CPI data. 
It presents a concise snapshot of the work I undertook during my Macroeconomics Research Internship.
The project brings together data processing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and 
index construction to study how inflation behaves across components and over time.

### 1. Data
Contains raw and processed CPI datasets used across the analysis and index construction.

### 2. Inflation Index Work
Includes the methodology, code, and supporting analysis used to construct a composite inflation index, along with seasonal adjustment procedures.

### 3. Dashboard
Visual summary capturing the dispersion of inflation across CPI components and threshold bands.
An interactive version of the dashboard is also available via Google Drive for ease of viewing:

### 4. Code
Python and R scripts used for exploratory analysis, component-wise inflation analysis, and supporting visualizations.
